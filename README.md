# kellets_whelk_rnaseq

## Project description
This is a project analyzing population structure and genetic adaptation of Kellet's whelks (Kelletia kelletii)  --- a range expanding marine species with high gene flow potential. We performed a series of crosses on Kellet's whelks collected from its historical and recently colonized range, and conducted RNA-Seq on offspring that we reared in a common garden environment. We conducted differential expression analysis on 54 samples with historical-range and expanded-range ancestry. We also used transcriptome derived SNPs to examine population structure and genetic adaptation.

## Scripts
Code for project is in [scripts](https://github.com/ChristieLab/kellets_whelk_rnaseq/tree/main/scripts). Analyses are split up into directories: 
1. _**Study system.** _R code associated with figure 1.
2. _**Sequence processing.**_ Process RNA transcripts and conduct DEG analysis
3. _**SNP calling.**_ Contains for SNP variant calling using ANGSD 
4. _**Population structure and population assignment.**_ R codes analyszing transcriptome-derived SNPs using snpR (Figure 2)
5. _**Candidate loci driving differntiation.**_  R codes analyszing transcriptome-derived SNPs using snpR, population assignment using rubias and ranger (Figure 3). R code analyzing the TPI gene (Figure 4)
6. _**Gene Ontology and WGCNA.** _R codes associated with analyses of expression data (Supplemental)
